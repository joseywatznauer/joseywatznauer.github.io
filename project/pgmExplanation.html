<h2>Recursive Mapping Fibonacci Sequence Python Program</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  In mathematics, the Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence in which each element is the sum of the two elements that precede it.
  Originating from Italian mathematician Fibonacci's 1202 book <cite>Liber Abaci</cite>, the original problem concerned 
  the reproduction of rabbits under perfect circumstances, and today, the "Golden Ratio" that the sequence produces is 
  known to appear often in nature.<br>
  The Fibonacci sequence is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <var>F<sub>n</sub></var> = <var>F<sub>n-1</sub></var> + <var>F<sub>n-2</sub></var>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is a Python program that calculates the requested Fibonacci sequence value:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <code>
      <pre>
        fibMap = {}

        def fib(n):
            if n < 3: #because first two values of the sequence are 1
                return 1
            elif n in fibMap.keys():
                return fibMap[n]
            else:
                result = fib(n-1) + fib(n - 2)
                fibMap[n] = result
                return result
            
        inputNum = int(input("Which value of the Fibonacci sequence would you like? "))
        answer = fib(inputNum)
        print("Answer: ", str(answer))
      </pre>
    </code>
  </blockquote>
<p>
  The program prompts the user for whichever value in the sequence they would like to see.
  If the user were to request the 6<sup>th</sup> value, he or she would enter <kbd>6</kbd>,
  and this value would be assigned to <var>inputNum</var>. When the recursive function reaches the base case,
  the program would output <samp>Answer: 8</samp>, because 8 is the 6<sup>th</sup> value of the Fibonacci sequence.<br>
  This program, known as <abbr title="Recursive Mapping Fibonacci Sequence Python Program">RMFSPP</abbr>, finds the Fibonacci sequence value using recursion.
  <dfn>Recursion</dfn> refers to a function that calls itself. This specific recursive program stores the known values
  in a dictionary so each time the "previous" value is needed to find the next value, it can find it in
  the dictionary instead of redoing all of the previous calcutions. <strong>This saves exponential amounts of time and processing power.</strong><br>
  As explained in <cite>Why the RMFSPP is the Best Program Ever</cite>, <q>The RMFSPP saves mathematicians and 
  bunny breeders time and work that can be better spent cuddling bunnies by calculating the Fibonacci sequence 
  values almost instantaneously, thanks to the combined benefits of recursion and Python dictionaries.</q>
